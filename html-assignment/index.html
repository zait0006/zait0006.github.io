    <h2>About me</h2>
    <main>
          <p> I was born in Dubai on the <sup>23rd</sup> of june, where life was vibrant amidst the warmth and endless activities. Swimming in its waters was a cherished pastime, Ienjoy reading and get complemented by enriching reads and engaging conversations.i love doing many things in  the day but nothing compared to the quality time spent with family and friends, another thing about me is that i love visiting Festivals wich they addd added to the city's allure all accompanied by the soothing melodies of music.</p>
        <p>I discovered my love for playing the piano as a child, mesmerized by the harmony my fingers could create. <q>Sometimes I can only groan, and suffer, and pour out my despair at the piano. Frederic Chopin</q> <abbr title= "In my opinion">IMO</abbr> this qote explain and express our suffer sometimes and how we deal with it playing piano, because its our <em>escape</em> sometimes. my love to travel aroun the world, fueled my love for exploration, despite my poor saving skills! I also embrace my artistic side, spending evenings lost in painting and creating new art</section>
